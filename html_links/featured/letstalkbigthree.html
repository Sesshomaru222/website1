            <h2>The Big Three</h2>
            <p>Firstly, I want to address the confusion in the Anime community as to which anime are the big three and why that is. 
                The big three consists exclusively of One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach&mdash;and to be clear, this list is immutable. Any other list you may have seen 
                as it relates to the topic is incorrect, and I'll explain why this is the case. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These three anime are considered the big three due to their 
                massive popularity during the early 2000s,
                their long-running manga series, and their significant impact on the anime industry as a whole during their era.
                Each of these series has a dedicated fanbase and has contributed to the global spread of anime culture.
                While other anime like Solo Leveling and My Hero Academia are incredibly popular, they do not hold the same historical 
                significance as the original big three.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dragon Ball Z on the other hand is often mistakenly included in discussions about the big three, but it predates 
                this era and is considered a separate entity in anime history. But don't worry, DBZ is still considered the grandfather
                of shonen anime and has paved the way for many series that followed (including the big three).
                The big three set the standard for shonen anime and paved the way for future series to gain international acclaim.
                In this article, I will discuss why these three anime deserve their spot as the big three and what makes them stand 
                out in the anime world.
