            <h2>The Big Three</h2>
            <p>Firstly, I want to address the confusion in the Anime community as to which anime are the big three and
                why that is.
                The big three consists exclusively of One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach&mdash;and to be clear, this list is
                immutable. Any other list you may have seen
                as it relates to the topic is incorrect, and I'll explain why this is the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                These three anime are considered the big three due to their
                massive popularity during the early 2000s,
                their long-running manga series, and their significant impact on the anime industry as a whole during
                their era.
                Each of these series has a dedicated fanbase and has contributed to the global spread of anime culture.
                While other anime like Solo Leveling and My Hero Academia are incredibly popular, they do not hold the
                same historical
                significance as the original big three.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dragon Ball Z on the other hand is often mistakenly included in discussions about the big three, but it
                predates
                this era and is considered a separate entity in anime history. But don't worry, DBZ is still considered
                the grandfather
                of shonen anime and has paved the way for many series that followed (including the big three).
                The big three set the standard for shonen anime and paved the way for future series to gain
                international acclaim.
                In this article, I will discuss why these three anime deserve their spot as the big three and what makes
                them stand
                out in the anime world.

                </p>
                <h3>Bleach</h3>
                <p>
                    Bleach, created by Tite Kubo, centers around Ichigo Kurosaki, a teenager who gains the powers of a

                    It has also garnered a dedicated fanbase and has been adapted into an anime series, movies, and

                <h3>Together</h3>
                <p>
                    The big three are all unique in their own way, but they share a common thread of excellence in
                    storytelling,
                    character development, and world-building. They have all contributed to the evolution of anime and
                    have
                    inspired countless creators and fans around the world. They held down the anime industry during
                    their
                    peak
                    years and continue to be beloved by fans of all ages.
