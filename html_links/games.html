            <h1>Here are my top tier game picks that everyone should play!</h1>

            <div class="pick">
                <h2>Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</h2>
                <hr>
                <img src="/website1/images/Skyrim-Wallpaper.png" alt="Elder Scrolls Wallpaper">
                <p>In the sphere of open world, exploration, hack and slash games there is no title more revered than this. 
                    It is true classic that stands the test of time. A fantastic storyline brimming with history, conflicts, and tension. 
                    A robust array of magical powers and mythical artifacts. An ethos absolutely flooded with the influence 
                    of various gods and daedra. Mystical beasts, forsaken races, political motivations and raging war&mdash;
                    this is a title worth more praise than I could even muster. This is a must for anyone who wants to waste away in 
                    their mothers basement with no regrets. In the world of games, this title sits at the very top as king.
                </p>
                
            </div>

            <div class="pick">
                <h2>Elden Ring</h2>
                <hr>
                <img src="/website1/images/Elden-Ring-Wallpaper.webp" alt="Elden Ring Wallpaper">
                <p>I consider this game a true predecessor to the afore mentioned king. It comes from a line of fabled games known as 
                    Drak Souls. It's creator, Hidetaka Miyazaki put all of his experience, knowledge, and vision into this title. Elden Ring is 
                    much like Skyrim. It's an open world game unbelievably rich in lore and shrouded in mystery. Fans of the game have 
                    spent countless hours piecing together the full picture for us. From the world's beloved god, queen Marika, to her 
                    first and second king consorts, to her children and half children&mdash;the demi gods, this story is one worthy of 
                    a trilogy of movies which would stand shoulder to shoulder with Lord of the Rings.
                </p>

            <div class="pick">
                <h2>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h2>
                <hr>
                <img src="/website1/images/Assassins-Creed-Odyssey-Wallpaper.jpg" alt="Odyssey Wallpaper">
                <p>Odyssey is one of my all time favorites. It has everything that I love&mdash;
                    a compelling storyline, a very, very large open world, mythological creatures, lore, secret organizations, 
                    and many other features. Sailing across Greece in your fairly customizable ship and fighting off &lpar;or invading&rpar; 
                    other vassels could be an entire game unto itself! The oceans are vast and the journey soothing, often I prefer sailing 
                    over fast travel options. An assassin's creed game has never felt so freeing.
                </p>

                <p>Out of the new breed of Assassin's creed games, this is one I believe is not talked about nearly enough, because 
                    it is honestly the peak of the new era and style of Assassin's Creed.
                </p>

            <div class="pick">
                <h2>Minecraft</h2>
                <hr>
                <img src="/website1/images/Minecraft-Wallpaper2.jpg" alt="Skyrim Image">
                <p>What can I say&mdash;Minecraft is a well known and well beloved title across systems. It effectively bridges the 
                    gap between pixel art and the 3D, open world games of today. Many people find the graphics too archaic, but as 
                    anyone who's played the game will tell you, this is a feature, not a flaw. 
                </p>

                <p>Minecraft is another one of those games rich in its own lore. From the sometimes scerene Overworld, where you 
                    first settle, to the terrifying and unforgiving Nether world, to the devoid realm of the End, this game will 
                    demand your full attention. Minecraft will have you hoarding resources, building, farming, fishing, and just 
                    enjoying the cozy life you make for yourself. However, if you're more adventurous than that, there are vast 
                    ocean, jungles, desert, mountain, and many other biomes to explore&mdash;each with their own secrets and 
                    treasures for you to amass. If you like to live on the edge, you can construct a nether portal and make your 
                    way to one of the most dangerous places known to this title. Instead of oceans, you'll find magma, and instead 
                    of sheep, you'll find monsters who want nothing more than to blow you to smitherines.
                </p>

                <p>There are many more biomes and much more to a Minecraft world than I will mention here, but I'll leave you to 
                    discover these on your own. After all, Minecraft is all about exploration and discovery.
                </p>

            <div class="pick">
                <h2>Middle Earth: Shadow of War</h2>
                <hr>
                <img src="/website1/images/Shadow-Of-War-Wallpaper.jpg" alt="Middle Earth Wallpaper">
                <p>A Lord of the Rings masterpiece without a doubt, Middle Earth: Shadow of War is phenominal. This title starts 
                    as reaction-time combat. As you progress through the game and become immensly powerful you unlock the defining 
                    feature of this game, the power to bend the will of your foes&mdash;turning powerful enemies into loyal 
                    subjects. At that point, the game becomes an army builder, where you weaken your opponents enough to have 
                    them succumb to your domineering gaze. You then promot captains, de-throne overlords and create new ones. 
                    That is the aspect of the game that I crave, but that certainly isn't all there is to it.
                </p>

                <p>The world is large, detailed, riddled with orcish politics and cruelty, and just an all around mean place to 
                    find yourself. But you are a force that will tame this world of darkness, and perhaps stand before the mighty 
                    Sauron himself.
                </p>
