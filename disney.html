            <p>
                For the past few decades, America's animation culture has been dominated by the the giant studio, 
                Disney, and for good reason! Disney has a special place in many of our hearts as it has a nack for 
                capturing our imagination and cultivating our emotions. Full of compassion, drama, love, empathy, 
                beauty&mdash;their stories are so much more than just stories. They are a fundamental component of 
                American culture, largely capturing our values and aspirations, dreams and sorrows.
            </p>

            <p>With Disney playing such a fundamental role in our society, I want to dive into what I chose for my top 
                picks and what makes them so special. Come along with me as I indulge in the splender of Disney!
