        <div class="pick">
            <h2>Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</h2>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/Skyrim-Wallpaper.png" alt="Skyrim Image">
            <p>In the sphere of open world, exploration, hack and slash games there is no title more revered than this. 
                It is true classic that stands the test of time. A fantastic storyline brimming with history, conflicts, and tension. 
                A robust array of magical powers and mythical artifacts. An ethos absolutely flooded with the influence 
                of various gods and daedra. Mystical beasts, forsaken races, political motivations and raging war&mdash;
                this is a title worth more praise than I could even muster. This is a must for anyone who wants to waste away in 
                their mothers basement with no regrets. In the world of games, this title sits at the very top as king.
            </p>

        <div class="pick">
            <h2>Elden Ring</h2>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/Elden-Ring-Wallpaper.webp" alt="Skyrim Image">
            <p>I consider this game a true predecessor to the afore mentioned king. It comes from a line of fabled games known as 
                Drak Souls. It's creator, Miazaki put all of his experience, knowledge, and vision into this title. Elden Ring is 
                much like Skyrim. It's an open world game unbelievably rich in lore and shrouded in mystery. Fans of the game have 
                spent countless hours piecing together the full picture for us. From the world's beloved god, queen Marika, to her 
                first and second king consorts, to her children and half children&mdash;the demi gods, this story is one worthy of 
                a trilogy of movies which would stand shoulder to shoulder with Lord of the Rings.
            </p>

            <h2>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h2>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/Assassins-Creed-Odyssey-Wallpaper.jpg" alt="Skyrim Image">
            <p>Odyssey is one of my all time favorites. It has everything that I love&mdash;
                a compelling storyline, a very, very large open world, mythological creatures, lore, secret organizations, 
                and many other features. Sailing across Greece in your customizable ship and fighting off or invading other vassels 
                could be an entire game unto itself! The oceans are so vast and the journey so soothing, often I prefer sailing 
                over fast travel options. An assassin's creed game has never felt so freeing.
            </p>

            <p>Out of the Assassin's creed games, this is one I believe is not talked about nearly enough, because 
                it is the peak of the new era and style of Assassin's Creed.
            </p>

            <h2>Minecraft</h2>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/Minecraft-Wallpaper2.jpg" alt="Skyrim Image">
            <p>What can I say&mdash;Minecraft is a well known and well beloved title across systems. It effectively bridges the 
                gap between pixel art and the 3D, open world games of today. Many people find the graphics too archaic, but as 
                anyone who's played the game will tell you, this is a feature, not a flaw. 
            </p>

            <p>Minecraft is another one of those games rich in its own lore. From the sometimes scerene Overworld, where you 
                first settle, to the terrifying and unforgiving Nether world, to the devoid realm of the End, this game will 
                demand your full attention. Minecraft will have you hoarding resources, building, farming, fishing, and just 
                enjoying the cozy life you make for yourself. However, if you're more adventurous than that, there are vast 
                ocean, jungles, desert, mountain, and many other biomes to explore&mdash;each with their own secrets and 
                treasures for you to amass. If you like to live on the edge, you can construct a nether portal and make your 
                way to one of the most dangerous places known to this title. Instead of oceans, you'll find magma, and instead 
                of sheep, you'll find monsters who want nothing more than to blow you to smitherines.
            </p>

            <p>There are many more biomes and much more to a Minecraft world than I will mention here, but I'll leave you to 
                discover these on your own. After all, Minecraft is all about exploration and discovery.
