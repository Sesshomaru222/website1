        <h1>Here are my top tier game picks that everyone should play!</h1>

        <div class="pick">
            <h2>Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</h2>
            <p>In the sphere of open world, exploration, hack and slash games there is no title is more revered than this. 
                It is true classic that stands the test of time. A fantastic storyline brimming with history, conflicts, and tension. 
                A robust array of magical powers and mythical artifacts. An ethos absolutely flooded with the influence 
                of various gods and daedra. Mystical beasts, forsaken races, political motivations and raging war&mdash;
                this is a title worth more praise than I could even muster. This is a must for anyone who wants to waste away in 
                their mothers basement with no regrets. In the world of games, this title sits at the very top as king.
            </p>

        <div class="pick">
            <h2>Elden Ring</h2>
            <p>I consider this game a true predecessor to the afore mentioned king. It comes from a line of fabled games known as 
                Drak Souls. It's creator, Miazaki put all of his experience, knowledge, and vision into this title. Elden Ring is 
                much like Skyrim. It's an open world game unbelievably rich in lore and shrouded in mystery. Fans of the game have 
                spent countless hours piecing together the full picture for us. From the world's beloved god, queen Marika, to her 
                first and second king consorts, to her children and half children&mdash;the demi gods, this story is one worthy of 
                a trilogy of movies which would stand shoulder to shoulder with Lord of the Rings.
            </p>

        <div class="pick">
            <h2>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h2>

            <p>Odyssey is one of my all time favorites. It has everything that I love&mdash;
                a compelling storyline, a very, very large open world, mythological creatures, lore, secret organizations, 
            etc.</p>
